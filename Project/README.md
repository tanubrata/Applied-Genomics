This was an independent Final Group Project for this course. My partner for the project was Mario.
We selected a Liver study dataset from GEO database with accession number GSE143318 where liver samples were collected from both healthy individuals and patients suffering from Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis (SAH).
We analyzed those raw RNASeq data by using **Differential Gene Expression Analysis, Enrichment Analysis and Alternative Splicing Analysis**. We used various tools including **FastQC, Trimmomatic, STAR, Kallisto, HTSeq, Picard**, and various **R bioconductor packages including LIMMA, GSEA, KEGG etc.**
We also wrote a Final Paper on this Project for submission as our Final Project.

The sbatch folder contains all the sbatch scripts ran on HPC for getting the data needed for analysis of Raw data. Later we used the data on RStudio to do all the analysis. The diff_expressed_genes.rmd is the script that contains all the codes for analysis in R.

All the codes and scripts are solely written by myself.
