This was an independent Final Group Project for this course. My partner for the project was Mario.
We selected a Liver study dataset from GEO database with accession number GSE143318 where liver samples were collected from both healthy individuals and patients suffering from Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis (SAH).
We analyzed those raw RNASeq data by using **Differential Gene Expression Analysis, Enrichment Analysis and Alternative Splicing Analysis**. We used various tools including **FastQC, Trimmomatic, STAR, Kallisto, HTSeq, Picard**, and various **R bioconductor packages including LIMMA, GSEA, KEGG etc.**
